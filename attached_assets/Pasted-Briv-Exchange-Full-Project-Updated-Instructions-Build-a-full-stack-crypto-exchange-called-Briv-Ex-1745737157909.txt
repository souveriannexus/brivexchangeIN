Briv Exchange — Full Project Updated Instructions

Build a full-stack crypto exchange called Briv Exchange.

Must work as a Web App (PC) + Mobile App (responsive).

Should use Single Page Application (SPA) design (React.js or Next.js preferred) so tabs don't throw "404 Page Not Found" errors.

Homepage (Landing Page) should show:

Overview of Briv Exchange (Logo, Tagline, About Us)

Top coins prices (small live market table)

Exchange statistics (like Volume 24h, Active Users, Coins Listed)

Simple registration/login button

Introductory sections (like "Why Trade With Briv", "Security First", "Low Fees", etc.)

Do NOT show the trading page directly on the homepage.

Navigation Tabs (all clickable, no 404 error):

Home

Spot Trading

Futures Trading

Margin Trading

P2P Trading

Wallets

Markets (price list of all coins)

Staking

Launchpad (future)

Support/Help Center

User Dashboard (Profile, Orders, etc.)

Technical Requirements:

Routing: Use React Router / Next.js routing → No broken links (no 404 unless truly missing page).

Responsive: Must work on Mobile + Desktop (with automatic resizing).

TradingView Charts: Use TradingView widget for professional trading charts.

WebSocket Integration: Live price updates without reloading page.

Authentication: Email + Google login + 2FA (later upgradeable to phone OTP).

Style:

Modern, minimalistic, dark-mode UI by default.

Soft animations (page transitions, hover effects).

Big, clear fonts for easy mobile viewing.

Security:

Secure routing

Secure user login

Backend protected by JWT tokens

Mobile App Compatibility (later step):

Build using Responsive WebApp now (works on phone browsers).

In Phase 2, you can wrap it using CapacitorJS / React Native WebView for native app publishing.

Important:
All tabs must be connected to real or dummy components, NO empty links, NO 404 errors inside app.
Home page must feel like a professional landing page, not direct trading dashboard.

Example flow:

Open website → See Home/Overview page.

Click on "Spot Trading" → Go to Spot Market page.

Click on "Futures Trading" → Go to Futures Dashboard.

Profile, Settings, Wallet → Must be accessible inside user login area.

Mobile → Menu collapses nicely, all links still work.
